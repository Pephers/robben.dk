# Catching huge trout in an extremely remote, hyper localized mouse hatch

A few days ago I picked up my friend Kresten from the airport in Christchurch. I had already been fishing the South Island of New Zealand for several weeks and had been teasing him with pictures of caught fish in great condition. Now he was finally here and hungry for fish. We started out successfully fishing a few spring creeks while the weather settled. With our thirst for trout now sated, we decided that once the weather window allowed us to, we would go on a big back country mission.

I suspected we might have a chance of finding a real treasure in our river of choice. I had visited the river the prior season, and I do not understate when I say that the beech bush was more red than green in this particular valley. Mind you, I’m not color blind either. The avid New Zealand trout angler knows that a flowering beech forest is followed by a mast event, which in turn creates a massive spike in rodent populations—particularly mice—that feed on the beech seed. Trout then feast on these mice during the following spring and summer and these so called mouse fish can obtain gargantuan proportions.

However, we hadn’t heard anything confirming if there was a mouse hatch going, and it was now February and late summer. So we guessed we had to do the hard work ourselves. Did that sound bad? Not at all. Super exciting? Very much so!

Kresten and I did the massive hike in to the river which took about three hours, not helped by Kresten’s massive 125 liter backpack and ex-military pride (stubbornness) to carry his heavy pack all the way. We caught a few fish on our way to our campsite. They were nice, clean fish in the 4-5 pound range, but they certainly hadn’t been on the protein rich diet we had hoped for. We set up camp as the sun descended behind the Southern Alps and had a quick dinner before checking out home pool for an evening rise. We soon spotted a trout, but it wasn’t rising. Instead, it was swinging deep down in the current of the head of the pool. Numerous casts later, after hitting just the right spot in the seam of two currents, the heavy nymph sank down and the fish took Kresten’s fly. It turned out to be a good-sized rainbow, but sadly just before I was able to net it for him, the hook pulled. As we learnt later, this would turn out to become a recurring theme…

## Frustration is building up

The following day, high on caffeine from the morning’s cowboy coffee, we marched upstream. After a while, we spotted a feeding trout. With the lost fish from last night still in our minds it was only fair to have Kresten get a first shot. It wasn&rsquo;t exactly throwing itself at the well-presented nymphs at the end of Kresten&rsquo;s leader, but in the end he got a satisfying take. Once Kresten got into contact with the fish it immediately took a run for it. Kresten really had to pull hard during the fight, but luck was ultimately on the fishes side as the hook pulled during the middle of the fight. Imagine the disappointment!

By the time we reached the next pool I was up again. The pool was a classic, glassy pool with a trout sitting almost motionless in the tailout. Remarkably, the fish didn&rsquo;t spook after the first few casts but neither did it take my fly. Only after changing to a big size 10 black stonefly did it move to ever so slowly inhale my fly. I could see the mouth flash and when its jaws finally closed did I lift my rod. Regardless, the hook didn&rsquo;t stick. This was our third fish we had lost in a row. This normally isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal, but in New Zealand every fish counts. Plus, you can _see_ what you just lost!

It was now mid afternoon and we had walked all day. We did each get a few more shots at fish, but with nothing but a small two-pound rainbow for Kresten to show for it. At least we now had now caught a fish, but our hopes for bigger specimens weren&rsquo;t exactly coming to fruition. Little did we know what was about to happen.

## The Pool

Ahead of us was another very nice pool with the bedrock creating a narrow channel of heavy flowing water. When we approached the tail out of the pool we were shocked when we spooked a massive brown trout that was sitting under the a ledge in very low water. It looked very big in the water, potentially a double figure fish (a fish weighing over 10 pounds.) What followed was even stranger. Instead of fully spooking as brown trout usually do, it simply moved into the main body of the pool. Here we saw at least three other big fish, and of course the spooked fish caused a lot commotion. I thought to myself that it was game over to catch any of these fish. Fish that by the way all looked like they had trophy potential! But after a few minutes the fish seemed to settle down. One of them even began actively feeding again. As I drew on my past experience from the last time there was a mouse season in 2019/2020 I started to recognize their behavior as the fish being on mice! There might yet be hope for us to get a chance at these fish, I thought.

Now, mouse fish behavior requires a bit of explanation: A normal New Zealand brown trout will freely feed in the crystal clear water, swinging to either side of its lie to take nymphs and dry flies drifting by. These fish are typically willing to take a an angler’s fly and move to take it so long as it is carefully presented in its feeding window. On the other hand, trout that are feeding on mice—mouse fish—are so well fed that it makes little sense for them to expend energy to take a tiny mayfly or caddis nymph. Instead, they tend to sit in deep, oxygenated water where they can digest all the mice they have eating during the night. So do you catch them on a mouse fly during the night? Well, possibly, but the main attraction of fishing in New Zealand is to sight fish to spotted fish in crystal clear water. Luckily, these mouse fish will take a fly, but you have to present it absolutely right in front of the fish for it to take the fly. My analogy for this behavior is Christmas dinner. You have been eating all night and are absolutely full. But when the chocolates or sweets are sent around the table, can you resist? I thought so, and neither can the trout.

Back to the pool with at least four trophy trout in it. Kresten was up first and was targeting the fish closest to him in the back of the pool. Knowing from past experience how mouse fish can still be caught even after having been soft spooked, Kresten rigged up with a heavy nymph. Then it was just a matter of repeatably casting until the trout would hopefully take the fly. TODO
